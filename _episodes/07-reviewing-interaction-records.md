### What is a review
-----

A *review* in GloBI is an output that lets us know how GloBI interpreted or viewed the data being indexed. It is an opportunity to see if we agree with the interpretation or find issues in the data we can correct. It also provides some cool statistics about the number of interaction records indexed from a particular dataset. Reviews are done by dataset only.
