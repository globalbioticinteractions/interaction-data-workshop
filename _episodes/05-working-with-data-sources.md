Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) [continuously indexes](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/process) existing species interaction datasets made available through data sources. These data sources include not only digitized natural history collections (e.g., [Arctos Collections](https://arctosdb.org)), but also data extracted from scientific papers (e.g., [Seltmann et al. 2020 Tick Interaction Database](https://github.com/ParasiteTracker/tick-interaction-database)) and custom data portals (e.g., [Bat Eco-Interactions/BatBase](https://batbase.org)).

A full list of GloBI data sources can be found at [https://globalbioticinteractions.org/sources](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/sources) . This data source list provides information on how GloBI found the data (e.g., index configuration), what was indexed (e.g., number of indexed interactions), recent review reports, a list of issues/discussions topics, and pointers to web-based data browsing tools.

Exercise 1. Find two data sources that contain of Ixodes (tick) interaction data via https://globalbioticinteractions.org .

Exercise 2. For a Ixodes dataset, discover the structured review reports.

Exercise 3. Browse interactions and references for only one data source.
